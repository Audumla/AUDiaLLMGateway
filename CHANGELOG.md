# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Scaffolded a native Windows local LLM gateway workspace in AUDiaLLMGateway. (New Feature)
- Created a Git-backed repo scaffold with config, docs, PowerShell wrappers, and Python orchestration for llama-server plus LiteLLM.
- Added health checks, routing tests, and config generation for local model profiles and future MCP registration.
- Ran py_compile, generated LiteLLM config, exercised the stop-stack wrapper, and passed pytest.

### Renamed the local LLM gateway workspace from AUDiaLLMEnvironment to AUDiaLLMGateway. (Documentation Update)
- Renamed the repo directory to AUDiaLLMGateway.
- Updated README and changelog references to the new project name.
- Re-ran tests and config generation from the renamed path.

### Added the first mid-level project spec for AUDiaLLMGateway. (Documentation Update)
- Created a specifications folder with a mid-level phase 1 gateway spec.
- Mapped the original plan to the current scaffold, config model, operational flows, and acceptance criteria.
- Kept the spec intentionally mid-level so follow-on low-level specs can expand backend, LiteLLM, and MCP details.

### Expanded spec-001 to define Windows-first scope and planned Linux options. (Documentation Update)
- Updated the mid-level spec to make Windows the active phase 1 target.
- Added Linux as a planned parallel platform with different launch and deployment options.
- Clarified that platform-specific differences should not change the external gateway contract.

### Refactored AUDiaLLMGateway to use llama-swap as the managed local backend behind LiteLLM. (New Feature)
- Replaced direct llama-server orchestration with a llama-swap runtime, generated config workflow, and LiteLLM alias publishing.
- Added a stack config, imported the provided llama-swap catalog as the repo baseline, and generated MCP client-facing config scaffolding.
- Added Windows install/update/generate scripts and updated docs/specs/tests for the new architecture.

### Moved AUDiaLLMGateway run artifacts into the Gateway workspace artifact root. (Configuration Cleanup)
- Migrated the Gateway-related codex plan-run directories out of AUDiaLLMOverseer artifact storage.
- Created the Gateway-local artifact root and confirmed no AUDiaLLMGateway run artifacts remain in the Overseer workspace.
- Re-ran pytest in AUDiaLLMGateway after the cleanup.

### Added release-based install/update, layered config preservation, install-state tracking, and component specs to AUDiaLLMGateway. (New Feature)
- Implemented a GitHub release installer/update path with bootstrap scripts for Windows, Linux, and macOS plus state tracking in state/install-state.json.
- Restructured config into project, local, and generated layers so updates preserve machine-local overrides while validation warns on conflicts.
- Added component and platform specs, installer manifest/state handling, and verified pytest, py_compile, config generation, config validation, installer help, and separation checks.

### Added versioned llama.cpp component management with backend selection to the Gateway installer model. (New Feature)
- Extended layered config and the release installer to treat llama.cpp as a managed component with backend/version settings and install-state tracking.
- Made generated llama-swap config capable of using the installed llama-server path from install state when local overrides do not replace it.
- Updated docs and specs for Windows Vulkan defaults and added installer tests for release asset selection.
